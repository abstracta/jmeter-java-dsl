&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Allows using JMeter Constant Throughput Timers which pauses samplers under its control to limit
&nbsp; * the maximum number of samples per minute.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * If you want the general throughput to be close to the specified number, and not significantly
&nbsp; * lower, then you have to make sure that the number of threads must be sufficient according to
&nbsp; * expected sampler response times.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The positioning of the timer determines its scope (as any other timer). I.e. at test plan level
&nbsp; * to control the pacing of multiple samples across multiple thread groups, under a Thread Group to
&nbsp; * just influence samplers in that Thread Group, or as a child of a sampler to only control that
&nbsp; * sampler.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * When located at test plan level, this timer will use  by default JMeter Constant Throughput Timer
&nbsp; * All active threads with non-sharing calculation mode. Which means that it will control that the
&nbsp; * total throughput for all requests in the test plan, across different thread groups, is at maximum
&nbsp; * the given one. If you locate inside a thread group (or sampler), it will use All active threads
&nbsp; * in current thread group with non-sharing mode. Avoiding potential problem of having two timers in
&nbsp; * separate thread group interfering with each other. Additionally, default calculation modes don&#39;t
&nbsp; * use shared modes since we have detected unexpected behaviors when using multiple timers.
&nbsp; * Basically, timers delays calculations interfering with each other due to single test plan or
&nbsp; * thread group mark used in calculation (instead of one per timer).
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * If you want to change the default calculation method, then you can use
&nbsp; * {@link #calculation(ThroughputMode)} method. But in general avoid using it since may lead to
&nbsp; * unexpected behaviors.
