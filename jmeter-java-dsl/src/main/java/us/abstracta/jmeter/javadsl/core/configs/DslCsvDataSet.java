/**
 * Allows using a CSV file as input data for JMeter variables to use in test plan.
 *
 * This element reads a CSV file and uses each line to generate JMeter variables to be used in each
 * iteration and thread of the test plan.
 *
 * Is ideal to be able to easily create test plans that test with a lot of different of potential
 * requests or flows.
 *
 * By default, it consumes comma separated variables, which names are included in first line of CSV,
 * automatically resets to the beginning of the file when the end is reached and the consumption of
 * the file is shared by all threads and thread groups in the test plan (ie: any iteration on a
 * thread will consume a line from the file, and advance to following line).
 *
 * Additionally, this element sets by default the "quoted data" flag on JMeter CSV Data Set
 * element.
