&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This class contains factory methods to create {@link DslTestElement} instances that allow
&nbsp; * specifying test plans and associated test elements (samplers, thread groups, listeners, etc.). If
&nbsp; * you want to support new test elements, then you either add them here (if they are considered to
&nbsp; * be part of the core of JMeter), or implement another similar class containing only the specifics
&nbsp; * of the protocol, repository, or grouping of test elements that you want to build (eg, one might
&nbsp; * implement an Http2JMeterDsl class with only http2 test elements&#39; factory methods).
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * When implement new factory methods consider adding only as parameters the main properties of the
&nbsp; * test elements (the ones that makes sense to specify in most of the cases). For the rest of
&nbsp; * parameters (the optional ones), prefer them to be specified as methods of the implemented
&nbsp; * {@link DslTestElement} for such case, in a similar fashion as Builder Pattern.
