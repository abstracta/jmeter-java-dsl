### Change sample result statuses with custom logic

Sometimes [response assertions](./response-assertion#check-for-expected-response) and JMeter default behavior are not enough, and custom logic is required. In such scenarios you can use `jsr223PostProcessor` as in this example where the 429 status code is not considered as a fail status code:

```java
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static us.abstracta.jmeter.javadsl.JmeterDsl.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.time.Duration;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import us.abstracta.jmeter.javadsl.core.TestPlanStats;

public class PerformanceTest {

  @Test
  public void testPerformance() throws IOException {
    TestPlanStats stats = testPlan(
        threadGroup(2, 10,
            httpSampler("http://my.service")
                .children(
                    jsr223PostProcessor(
                        "if (prev.responseCode == '429') { prev.successful = true }")
                )
        )
    ).run();
    assertThat(stats.overall().sampleTimePercentile99()).isLessThan(Duration.ofSeconds(5));
  }

}
```

You can also use a Java lambda instead of providing Groovy script, which benefits from Java type safety & IDEs code auto-completion:

```java
jsr223PostProcessor(s -> {
    if ("429".equals(s.prev.getResponseCode())) {
      s.prev.setSuccessful(true);
    }
})
```

::: warning
Using this last approach is currently only supported when using an embedded JMeter engine (no support for saving to JMX and running it in JMeter GUI, or running it with BlazeMeter or OctoPerf).
:::

Check [DslJsr223PostProcessor](/jmeter-java-dsl/src/main/java/us/abstracta/jmeter/javadsl/core/postprocessors/DslJsr223PostProcessor.java) for more details and additional options.

::: warning
JSR223PostProcessor is a very powerful tool but is not the only, nor the best, alternative for many cases where JMeter already provides a better and simpler alternative. For instance, the previous example might be implemented with previously presented [Response Assertion](./response-assertion#check-for-expected-response).
