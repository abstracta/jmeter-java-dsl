## Advanced threads configuration

jmeter-java-dsl provides two simple ways of creating thread groups which are used in most scenarios:

* specifying threads and the number of iterations each thread should execute before ending the test plan
* specifying threads and duration for which each thread should execute before the test plan ends

This is how they look in code:

```java
threadGroup(10, 20) // 10 threads for 20 iterations each
threadGroup(10, Duration.ofSeconds(20)) // 10 threads for 20 seconds each
```

But these options are not good when working with many threads or when trying to configure some complex test scenarios (like when doing incremental or peak tests).
