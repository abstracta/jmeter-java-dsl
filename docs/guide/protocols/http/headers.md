#### Headers

You might have already noticed in some of the examples that we have shown already some ways to set some headers. For instance, in the following snippet `Content-Type` header is being set in two different ways:

```java
httpSampler("http://my.service")
  .post("{\"field\":\"val\"}", Type.APPLICATION_JSON)
httpSampler("http://my.service")
  .contentType(Type.APPLICATION_JSON)
```

These are handy methods to specify the `Content-Type` header, but you can also set any header on a particular request using provided `header` method, like this:

```java
httpSampler("http://my.service")
  .header("X-First-Header", "val1")
  .header("X-Second-Header", "val2")
```

Additionally, you can specify headers to be used by all samplers in a test plan, thread group, transaction controllers, etc. For this you can use `httpHeaders` like this:

```java
testPlan(
    threadGroup(2, 10,
        httpHeaders()
          .header("X-Header", "val1"),
        httpSampler("http://my.service"),
        httpSampler("http://my.service/users")
    )
).run();
```

::: tip
You can also use lambda expressions for dynamically building HTTP Headers, but the same limitations apply as in other cases (running in BlazeMeter, OctoPerf, or using generated JMX file).
