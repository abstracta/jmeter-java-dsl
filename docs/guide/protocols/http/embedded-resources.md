#### Embedded resources

Sometimes you may need to reproduce a browser behavior, downloading for a given URL all associated resources (images, frames, etc.).

jmeter-java-dsl allows you to easily reproduce this scenario by using the `downloadEmbeddedResources` method in `httpSampler` like in the following example:

```java
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static us.abstracta.jmeter.javadsl.JmeterDsl.*;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.time.Duration;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import us.abstracta.jmeter.javadsl.core.TestPlanStats;

public class PerformanceTest {

  @Test
  public void testPerformance() throws IOException {
    TestPlanStats stats = testPlan(
        threadGroup(5, 10,
            httpSampler("http://my.service/")
                .downloadEmbeddedResources()
        )
    ).run();
    assertThat(stats.overall().sampleTimePercentile99()).isLessThan(Duration.ofSeconds(5));
  }

}
```

This will make JMeter automatically parse the HTTP response for embedded resources, download them and register embedded resources downloads as sub-samples of the main sample.

Check [JMeter documentation](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Request) for additional details on downloaded embedded resources.

::: tip
You can use `downloadEmbeddedResourcesNotMatching(urlRegex)` and `downloadEmbeddedResourcesMatching(urlRegex)` methods if you need to ignore, or only download, some embedded resources requests. For example, when some requests are not related to the system under test.
:::

::: warning
The DSL, unlike JMeter, uses by default concurrent download of embedded resources (with up to 6 parallel downloads), which is the most used scenario to emulate browser behavior.
