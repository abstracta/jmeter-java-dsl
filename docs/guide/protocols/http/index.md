### HTTP

Throughout this guide, several examples have been shown for simple cases of HTTP requests (mainly how to do gets and posts), but the DSL provides additional features that you might need to be aware of.

Here we show some of them, but check [JmeterDsl](/jmeter-java-dsl/src/main/java/us/abstracta/jmeter/javadsl/JmeterDsl.java) and [DslHttpSampler](/jmeter-java-dsl/src/main/java/us/abstracta/jmeter/javadsl/http/DslHttpSampler.java) to explore all available features.
